# Single source of truth

This file is the canonical entrypoint for current project state.

## Authority order

1. `docs/research-plan.md` — product scope, research architecture, evidence rules, gates and experiment order.
2. `docs/findings/*` and `research/*` — evidence supporting or falsifying the plan. They do not silently override it.
3. `docs/findings/field-feedback-findability-2026-09-07.md` + `research/evaluation/v31/field-feedback-findability-2026-09-07.json` — current real-user field-feedback evidence and frozen derived corpus.

## Current amendment — 2026-09-09: Track-2 architecture breadth complete

The short Track-2 architecture breadth phase is complete. **A — teacher-expanded sparse retrieval — is the surviving simple architecture family.**

The breadth comparison deliberately avoided rescue sweeps and hybrid composition:

- **B supervised sparse** loses to its same-feature centroid control on the fixed 593 teacher holdouts and also trails A on the frozen 66-case hard-confusion gate;
- **C task/activity representation** reaches only `46/66` Top1 and `50/66` correct confusion-pair side versus A `62/66` and `63/66`;
- **E rank-64 latent student** fits the frontend-size budget (~0.84 MB gzip estimate) but also reaches only `46/66` Top1 versus A `62/66`, and strongly regresses on the fixed 593 construction holdout;
- the deferred two-stage **D coarse retrieval -> local discriminator is NOT activated** because the dedicated hard-confusion evidence does not demonstrate a need for another semantic stage.

Therefore the active Track-2 execution order is now:

- freeze A593 ranker architecture and keep A2105/full Gemma generation paused;
- do not resume stemming/hub/hard-negative/pair-rule micro-tuning;
- test **training-language distribution inside A** as the next bounded falsifier;
- use a separately frozen, source-bound, lexically more distant user-language training corpus and a separate prefrozen transfer proxy;
- compare current A against A + diversified language over the same A593 candidate universe;
- opened 17/88 remains replay-only and may not choose the new language/prompt;
- scale diversified language to all A593 or A2105 only if the bounded transfer gain is material;
- if language diversity also fails materially, do not build a B/C/E/D hybrid stack merely to chase benchmark gains; reassess the residual against the server/API escape hatch and fresh human evidence.

The simplicity contract remains: **exact/canonical lexical route + one semantic description ranker/index**. A second semantic stage remains disallowed absent new evidence that clears the stronger complexity bar.

Detailed closeout evidence:

- `docs/findings/compile-time-architecture-breadth-result-2026-09-09.md`
- `research/evaluation/v31/compile-time-semantic-architecture-breadth-result.json`

The previous breadth-opening decision is retained as history:

- `docs/findings/compile-time-architecture-breadth-gate-2026-09-08.md`
- `research/evaluation/v31/compile-time-semantic-architecture-breadth-gate.json`

## Current amendment — 2026-09-07: bounded Track-1 field-feedback replay

The field-feedback finding is new independent user evidence of the exact class that `docs/research-plan.md` names as a trigger for renewed product investigation.

Therefore the older sentence in section 2.1.1 that says Track 1 is simply `PARKED` is stale in one narrow respect:

- broad Track-1 expansion remains parked;
- **a bounded Track-1 field-feedback replay is ACTIVE**;
- its purpose is only to classify the 2026-09-07 real-user failures against exact current YV/KV behaviour and promote reproduced product-native defects to the owning repository;
- Track 2 remains active and is not replaced by this replay;
- consumer-service investigation is out of scope; that team has been informed separately.

The detailed evidence and action order are in `docs/findings/field-feedback-findability-2026-09-07.md`.

At the next safe consolidation of the large living research plan, both current amendments should be folded into the relevant sections and reduced to pointers. Until then, this root file resolves status precedence explicitly so no future session needs conversation memory to recover the active execution order.

## Cross-repository boundary

`kingkong-projek/semantic-taxonomy-search` owns evidence, classification, semantic-retrieval research and the decision about whether a residual justifies Track 2.

`kingkong-projek/yrkesvaljaren` owns reproducible YV/KV product behaviour, fixes and regression tests. Its feedback-specific product SSOT is `docs/findability-feedback-ssot.md`.
